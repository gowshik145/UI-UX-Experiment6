NAME: GOWSHIK S (212223220026)

Issue in a Public Transport Ticket Booking App
Users struggle to find the correct bus/train, compare timings, and book fast during rush 
hours.

# ALGORITHM:

## 1. Solution Ideation – Crazy 8s
Problem:
Difficulty in quickly booking a bus/train ticket during peak hours.

## 8 Low-Fidelity Idea Concepts:

1. Instant Route Match: Users type the destination → app shows the next 5 departing 
buses/trains instantly.
2. Live Seat Map: Real-time seat availability with color codes. 
3. Fast Book Button: Auto-fills frequent routes and passenger details.
4. Crowd Density Indicator: Shows the crowd level inside the bus/train.
5. Smart Alerts: Notifies when seats open on a fully booked route.
6. Fare Comparison: Compares ticket prices across travel modes (bus vs metro vs 
train).
7. Voice Search: User speaks “Bus to Chennai at 6 PM” → app fetches options.
8. One-Click Pass: Auto-generated digital bus pass for daily commuters.
  
## 2. User Stories

1. As a daily commuter, I want to book my regular route quickly,
so that I don’t miss the bus during rush hours.

2. As a new user, I want to compare different travel options,
so that I can choose the cheapest and fastest one.

3. As a student, I want to see real-time seat availability,
so that I know whether I will get a seat or not.

4. As a traveler, I want to live tracking of the bus/train,
so that I can reach the station on time.

5. As an elderly passenger, I want simple icons and fewer steps,
so that I can book without confusion.

## 3. Scenario (Narrative)
Chosen User Story:
```
“As a daily commuter, I want to book my regular route quickly so that I don’t miss the bus.”
Scenario:
Gowshik is a 20-year-old college student who takes the same route every morning. he 
wakes up late and fears he may miss his 7:45 AM bus. While feeling anxious and rushed, he 
opens the transport app.
The home screen shows a “Fast Book” option with his usual route pre-filled. he taps it and 
sees the next departure time along with the live seat map. The crowd level indicator shows 
“Medium,” so he feels relieved.
he confirms the booking in one tap and receives a QR ticket immediately. Gowshik rushes 
out but feels calm knowing his seat is confirmed and he won’t miss his class.
